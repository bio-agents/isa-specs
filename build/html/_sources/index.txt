Introduction
------------
ISA is a metadata framework to manage an increasingly diverse set of life science, environmental and biomedical experiments that employ one or a
combination of technologies. Built around the **Investigation** (the project context), **Study** (a unit of research)
and **Assay** (analytical measurements) concepts, ISA helps you to provide rich
descriptions of experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technology and measurement types, sample-to-data
relationships) so that the resulting data and discoveries are reproducible and reusable.

.. note::
    For an introduction to ISA, please read the paper, `Towards interoperable bioscience data <http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n2/full/ng.1054.html>`_ published in *Nature Genetics*. For more details on the ISA framework and supported agents, please see http://www.isa-agents.org

The ISA Model and Serialization Specifications define an Abstract Model of the metadata framework. The ISA Abstract Model
has been implemented in two format specifications, ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON, both of which have supporting agents and
services associated with them. The format specifications are also available for additional agenting to take advantage
of ISA-formatted content.

These specifications are primarily aimed at software engineers to facilitate the development of automated export from
databases, or import into analytical or other agents.
