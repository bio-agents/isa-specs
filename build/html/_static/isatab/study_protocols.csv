Label,Datatype,Description
Study Protocol Name,String,"The name of the protocols used within the ISA-Tab document. The names are used as identifiers within the ISA-Tab document and will be referenced in the Study and Assay files in the Protocol REF columns. Names can be either local identifiers, unique within the ISA Archive which contains them, or fully qualified external accession numbers."
Study Protocol Type,String,"Term to classify the protocol. The term can be free text or from, for example, a controlled vocabulary or an ontology. If the latter source is used the Term Accession Number and Term Source REF fields below are required."
Study Protocol Type Term Accession Number,String,The accession number from the Term Source associated with the selected term.
Study Protocol Type Term Source REF,String,Identifies the controlled vocabulary or ontology that this term comes from. The Source REF has to match one of the Term Source Name declared in the Ontology Source Reference section.
Study Protocol Description,String,A free-text description of the protocol.
Study Protocol URI,String,Pointer to protocol resources external to the ISA-Tab that can be accessed by their Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
Study Protocol Version,String,An identifier for the version to ensure protocol tracking.
Study Protocol Parameters Name,String,"A semicolon-delimited ("";"") list of parameter names, used as an identifier within the ISA-Tab document. These names are used in the Study and Assay files (in the ""Parameter Value []"" column heading) to list the values used for each protocol parameter. Refer to section Multiple values fields in the Investigation File on how to encode multiple values in one field and match term sources"
Study Protocol Parameters Term Accession Number,String,The accession number from the Term Source associated with the selected term.
Study Protocol Parameters Term Source REF,String,Identifies the controlled vocabulary or ontology that this term comes from. The Source REF has to match one of the Term Source Name declared in the Ontology Source Reference section.
Study Protocol Components Name,String,"A semicolon-delimited ("";"") list of a protocol's components; e.g. instrument names, software names, and reagents names. Refer to section Multiple values fields in the Investigation File on how to encode multiple components in one field and match term sources."
Study Protocol Components Type,String,"Term to classify the protocol components listed for example, instrument, software, detector or reagent. The term can be free text or from, for example, a controlled vocabulary or an ontology. If the latter source is used the Term Accession Number and Term Source REF fields below are required."
Study Protocol Components Type Term Accession Number,String,The accession number from the Source associated to the selected terms.
Study Protocol Components Type Term Source REF,String,Identifies the controlled vocabulary or ontology that this term comes from. The Source REF has to match a Term Source Name previously declared in the ontology section
