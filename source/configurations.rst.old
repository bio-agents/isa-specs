Configurations
--------------
In the ISA framework, we define Configurations as a way to add constraints on the Abstract Model elements. For a given
experimental descriptor we may want to declare what minimum information should be present. Configurations can specify
what fields should be present and also what datatypes are valid values. In addition to this, we can also specify
the experimental workflow patterns that the Assay object should allow according to the type of measurement defined for
an assay, and the type of technology used for collecting the relevant data (e.g. sequencing or imaging technologies).

For example, we may create a configuration that mandates that Investigation metadata MUST record the title, author list,
and description. The Abstract Model specification only specifies that these SHOULD be present. Therefore the
configuration specifies additional constraints on a reference implementation of ISA that can be provided by users
beyond the reference implementation developers, e.g. Users, curators, publishers, etc.

For example, we mandate that the Study graphs MUST follow the (source)->(sample collection->(sample) pattern. A
reference implementation could specify this as a configuration if it is not hard-coded in the reference implementation.

Where the power of configurations becomes more apparent is where we want to describe Assay graphs. A data publisher
might provide a configuration specification that mandates that valid submissions to the data publisher from
researchers must follow something like

.. code-block:: none

  (sample)->(nucleic acid extraction)->(extract)->(nucleic acid sequencing)->(raw data)

for a technology/measurement type combination of genome sequencing/nucleotide sequencing. A configuration for a
different technology/measurement type combination of SNP analysis/DNA microarray might specify

.. code-block:: none

  (sample)->(DNA extraction)->(extract)->(nucleic acid hybridization)->(data collection)->(raw data)

Configurations MUST add constraints to the reference implementation of the Abstract Model.

How configurations are implemented is left open to reference implementation developers, but the point is to allow users
of reference implementations of the ISA Abstract Model to add constraints to ISA content in a flexible manner.
Configurations are implemented differently between the ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON formats, so please refer to those
respective specifications for further information on how to use them, or to see examples of how they are implemented.

ISA-Tab configurations
----------------------
Configurations for ISA-Tab content are implemented in XML files.

XML Configurations MUST declare the measurement and technology type of context, and MUST declare the valid column
names and ordering that are required. An XML schema describing the configuration format is available from
https://github.com/ISA-agents/isa-api/blob/master/isaagents/schemas/isatab_configurator.xsd To view example configurations,
please see here: https://github.com/ISA-agents/isa-api/tree/master/isaagents/config/xml
