Software agents
==============

The ISA Model Specification has two Reference Implementations as data formats (:doc:`ISA-Tab </isatab>` and
:doc:`ISA-JSON </isajson>`) with supporting software agents. Below is a summary list of agents and supported formats.

- **Active**: In active development and fully supported.
- **Maintenance mode**: No new features are being developed or planned, and only basic support and bug fixes will be supported.
- **Unsupported**: Not in development and no support available.
